This repository contains implementation of Linear Regression using scikit- linearmodel and statsmodels- ols model.

The data set contains information about planets such as density, orbital period, escape velocity and others. 

Then we look for any correlation between the target and feature. Here the target is to calculate OrbitalPeriod using the other information provided.

Finally the model is verified using fscore and p value for residuals value.
